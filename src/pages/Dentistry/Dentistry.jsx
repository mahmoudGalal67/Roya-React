            <h3>Pregnancy Ultrasound</h3>
            <p>
              Basically first we need to check if damage has reached to root
              canal or no using dental X Ray. Later if its just superficial
              decay , we can go for composite filling .

            <h3>Crowns</h3>
            <p>
              Even if you have done composite filling its better to put a dental
              crown on it to prevent the risk of any future break of the tooth
              because the tooth is less strong after primary repair.

            <h3>Veneers</h3>
            <p>
              Veneers can cover your teeth to give better and more shiny color
              and improve your smile .there is 2 kind of veneer called composite
              veneer and ceramic veneer. We prefer ceramic ones because its
              color donâ€™t change by time .

            <h3>Implants</h3>
            <p>
              Although we do our best to prevent from any tooth extraction but
              if there is any we can fill in with dental implant . having empty
              tooth space causes the other teeth by time and changes the teeth
              arrangement and sometimes causes loosening of teeth.

            <h3>Dentures</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes its better to use denture instead of dental implants ,
              our doctors will evaluate and tell you actually with method is
              better and whats the pros and cons of each treatment plan .
